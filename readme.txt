The NAYTEV Plugin for wordpress connects your Wordpress site to your NAYTEV dashboard without writing any code.

== Description ==

<p>Naytev is a share testing tool that optimizes how content is shared from sites to social media. The platform creates pre-populated share message and tracks to see which variations perform better.  You can put in as many message variants (different titles & pictures) as you want for users to share the content to improve referral traffic. </p>

<p>This add-on allows for two click installation of Naytev to your blog.  First create an account and site on  <a href="https://www.naytev.com">Naytev</a>, then you copy your embed code to the wordpress plugin. Isnâ€™t that easy! </p>
